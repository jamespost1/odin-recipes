# Basic Recipe Website

## Overview
This project is a **basic recipe website** built entirely with **HTML**. It’s a hands-on exercise designed to practice and solidify fundamental HTML skills — focusing on structure, semantics, and linking between pages.  

The website consists of:
- A **main index page** that lists multiple recipes.  
- Individual **recipe pages** for each dish, containing images, ingredient lists, and preparation steps.  

At this stage, the goal is to **write clean, well-structured HTML** — not to design a polished layout. CSS and additional styling will be added later in a future phase.

- Learn to structure web pages with headings, paragraphs, lists, and images.
