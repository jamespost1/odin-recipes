# Odin Recipes

## Overview
**Odin Recipes** is a simple multi-page website built entirely with HTML.  
The project demonstrates fundamental front-end development skills — structuring pages, linking between them, and organizing content semantically.  

This was created as part of The Odin Project’s Foundations curriculum to strengthen core HTML skills before introducing CSS or JavaScript.
